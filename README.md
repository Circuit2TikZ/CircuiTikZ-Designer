## Overview

CircuiTi*k*Z-Designer bridges the gap between visual circuit design and precise LaTeX code, letting you design, customize, and export diagrams without manually writing TikZ commands.
Whether you’re preparing academic papers, teaching materials, or engineering documentation, CircuiTi*k*Z-Designer provides:

- A clean, intuitive interface for fast diagram creation
- An extensive component library for all your circuit needs
- Real-time previews and instant export to high-quality LaTeX code

Stop wrestling with code syntax — focus on your circuit design, and let CircuiTikZ-Designer handle the Ti*k*Z.
